# DL-ANN-Customer_Churn_Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks using various resampling techniques.

Customer churn also known as customer defection is the loss of clients or customers. Telephone service companies often use customer churn analysis and customer churning rates as one of their key business metrics. For this project, we will be exploring the dataset of a telecom company and try to predict the customer churn. Using a neuron network binary classification, classify whether or not the customer will churn.
